# VDOT

This layer executes all optimizations from [VDOT](https://github.com/The-Virtual-Desktop-Team/Virtual-Desktop-Optimization-Tool).
The repository is copied into this repository, instead of downloaded, because more optimizations are enabled then set by default in the repo.

This layer can be updated once in a while by downloading the repo content into the resources folder and reconsidering all changes this repo makes.
